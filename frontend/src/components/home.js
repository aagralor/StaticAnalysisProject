        <h2>Developer code review tool</h2>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>Code review is a part of the software development process that involves checking the source code to identify errors at an early stage. A code review process is typically carried out before merging with the base code.</p>
        <p>Effective code review prevents errors and bugs from being introduced into the project, improving code quality at an early stage of the software development process.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2>Code review process</h2>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>The main objective of the code review process is to evaluate any new code for errors, failures and quality standards set by the organization. The code review process should not consist only of one-sided feedback. Therefore, an intangible benefit of the code review process is the improvement of the coding skills of the collective team.</p>

        <h2>Code review is critical</h2>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>The code review process is critical because it is never part of the formal curriculum in schools. You can learn the nuances of a programming language and project management, but code review is a process that evolves as an organization progresses.</p>
        <p>Code review is critical for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have no errors in the code.</li>
            <li>Minimize your chances of having problems.</li>
            <li>Confirm that the new code adheres to the guidelines.</li>
            <li>Increase the efficiency of the new code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Revisions to codes lead to an improved experience for other team members. Since a senior developer usually performs a code review, a junior developer can use this information to improve his own coding.</p>
